    "# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of the data and the model to be built, you can separate the learning problems into two broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning. \n",
    "They are the methods in which the training set contains additional attributes that you want to predict (target). \n",
    "  ##### Classification: \n",
    "The data in the training set belong to two or more classes or categories; then, the data, already being labeled, allow us to teach the system to recognize the characteristics that distinguish each class. When you will need to consider a new value unknown to the system, the system will evaluate its class according to its characteristics.\n",
    " ###### Regression: \n",
    "When the value to be predicted is a continuous variable. The simplest case to understand is when you want to find the line which describes the trend from a series of points represented in a scatterplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised learning. \n",
    "These are the methods in which the training set consists of a series of input values x without any corresponding\n",
    "target value.\n",
    " ##### Clustering: \n",
    " The goal of these methods is to discover groups of similar examples in a dataset.\n",
    " ##### Dimensionality reduction: \n",
    " Reduction of a high-dimensional dataset to one with only two or three dimensions is useful not just for data\n",
    "visualization, but for converting data of very high dimensionality into data of much lower dimensionality such that each of the lower dimensions conveys much more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these two main categories, there is a further group of methods which have the purpose of validation and evaluation of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Training Set and Testing Set\n",
    "Machine learning enables learning some properties by a model from a data set and applying them to new data. This is because a common practice in machine learning is to evaluate an algorithm. This valuation consists of splitting the data into two parts, one called the training set, with which we will learn the properties of the data, and the other called the testing set, on which to test these properties."
